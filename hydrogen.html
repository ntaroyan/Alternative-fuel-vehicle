    <p>A <strong>hydrogen</strong> car is an automobile which uses hydrogen as its primary source of power for locomotion.
	  These cars generally use the hydrogen in one of two methods: combustion or fuel-cell conversion. In combustion,
	  the hydrogen is "burned" in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, 
	  the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, 
	  the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water, however during combustion with air NOx can be produced.</p>
	  <p><i><b>Honda</b></i> introduced its fuel cell vehicle in 1999 called the FCX and have since then introduced the second generation FCX Clarity. 
	  Limited marketing of the FCX Clarity, based on the 2007 concept model, began in June 2008 in the United States, and it was introduced in Japan in November 2008.
	  The FCX Clarity was available in the U.S. only in Los Angeles Area, where 16 hydrogen filling stations are available, and until July 2009,
	  only 10 drivers have leased the Clarity for US$600 a month. At the 2012 World Hydrogen Energy Conference, Daimler AG, Honda, Hyundai and Toyota all confirmed plans
	  to produce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for sale by 2015, with some types planned to enter the showroom in 2013. From 2008 to 2014,
	  Honda leased a total of 45 FCX units in the US.</p>
	  <p>A small number of prototype hydrogen cars currently exist, and a significant amount of research is underway to make the technology more viable.
	  The common internal combustion engine, usually fueled with gasoline (petrol) or diesel liquids, can be converted to run on gaseous hydrogen.
	  However, the most efficient use of hydrogen involves the use of fuel cells and electric motors instead of a traditional engine. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen 
	  inside the fuel cells, which produces electricity to power the motors. One primary area of research is hydrogen storage, to try to increase the range of hydrogen 
	  vehicles while reducing the weight, energy consumption, and complexity of the storage systems. Two primary methods of storage are metal hydrides and compression.
	  Some believe that hydrogen cars will never be economically viable and that the emphasis on this technology is a diversion from the development and popularization 
	  of more efficient hybrid cars and other alternative technologies.
    <p>A study by The Carbon Trust for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport 
	  with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation. However, the technologies face very difficult challenges, 
	  in terms of cost, performance and policy. Buses, trains, PHB bicycles, canal boats, cargo bikes, golf carts, motorcycles, wheelchairs, ships, airplanes, submarines, 
	  and rockets can already run on hydrogen, in various forms. NASA used hydrogen to launch Space Shuttles into space. A working toy model car runs on solar power, using 
      a regenerative fuel cell to store energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gas. It can then convert the fuel back into water to release the solar energy.</p>
    <p><i><b>BMW's</b></i> Clean Energy internal combustion hydrogen car has more power and is faster than hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. A limited series production of the 7 Series Saloon
	   was announced as commencing at the end of 2006. A BMW hydrogen prototype (H2R) using the driveline of this model broke the speed record for hydrogen cars at 300 km/h (186 mi/h),
	   making automotive history. Mazda has developed Wankel engines to burn hydrogen. The Wankel uses a rotary principle of operation, so the hydrogen burns in a different part 
	   of the engine from the intake. This reduces pre-detonation, a problem with hydrogen fueled piston engines.
       The other major car companies like <i><b>Daimler, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Ford and General Motors,</b></i> are investing in hydrogen fuel cells instead. <i><b>VW, Nissan, 
       and Hyundai/Kia</b></i> also have fuel cell vehicle prototypes on the road. In addition, transit agencies across the globe are running prototype fuel cell buses. 
	   Fuel cell vehicles, such as the new Honda Clarity, can get up to 70 miles (110 km) on a kilogram of hydrogen.</p>
    <p>The <i><b>Hyundai</b></i>ix35 FCEV fuel cell vehicle is available for lease in the U.S. In 2014, a total of 54 units were leased. Sales of the Toyota Mirai to government 
	   and corporate customers began in Japan on December 15, 2014. Toyota delivered the first market placed Mirai to the Prime Minister's Official Residence and announced 
	   it got 1,500 orders in Japan in one month after sales began against a sales target of 400 for 12 months.
       Deliveries to retail customers began in California in October 2015. A total of 57 units were delivered between October and November 2015. 
	   Toyota scheduled to release the Mirai in the Northeastern States in the first half of 2016. The market launch in Europe is slated for September 2015.</p>
