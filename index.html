   <h1>Alternative fuel vehicle</h1>
   
      <p>An <b>alternative fuel vehicle</b> is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other than traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_fuel" alt="Petrolium Fuel">petroleum fuels</a> (petrol or Diesel fuel); 
        and also refers to any technology of powering an engine that does not involve solely petroleum (e.g. <em>electric car, hybrid electric vehicles,
        solar powered</em>). Because of a combination of factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices and the potential for peak oil, 
        development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power systems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle manufacturers around the world.
        Hybrid electric vehicles such as the <i>Toyota Prius</i> are not actually alternative fuel vehicles, but through advanced technologies in the electric battery and motor/generator, 
        they make a more efficient use of petroleum fuel. Other research and development efforts in alternative forms of power focus on developing all-electric and fuel cell vehicles,
        and even the stored energy of compressed air.
        An environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A life-cycle assessment of a vehicle involves production and post-use considerations.
        A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as the type of fuel.</p>
