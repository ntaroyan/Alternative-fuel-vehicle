    <p><strong>Solar</strong> car is an electric vehicle powered by solar energy obtained from solar panels on the car. Solar panels cannot currently be used to directly supply 
	  a car with a suitable amount of power at this time, but they can be used to extend the range of electric vehicles. They are raced in competitions such as the
	  World Solar Challenge and the North American Solar Challenge. These events are often sponsored by Government agencies such as the United States Department of Energy 
	  keen to promote the development of alternative energy technology such as solar cells and electric vehicles. Such challenges are often entered by universities to develop 
	  their students engineering and technological skills as well as motor vehicle manufacturers such as <i>GM</i>and <i>Honda.</i>
    <p>The North American Solar Challenge is a solar car race across North America. Originally called Sunrayce, organized and sponsored by General Motors in 1990, 
	  it was renamed American Solar Challenge in 2001, sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
	  Teams from universities in the United States and Canada compete in a long distance test of endurance as well as efficiency, 
	  driving thousands of miles on regular highways.</p>
	<p><em><b>Nuna</b></em> is the name of a series of manned solar powered vehicles that won the World solar challenge in Australia three times in a row, in 2001 (Nuna 1 or just Nuna), 
	  2003 (Nuna 2) and 2005 (Nuna 3). The <em><b>Nunas</b></em> are built by students of the Delft University of Technology.
       The World solar challenge is a solar powered car race over 3,021 kilometres (1,877 mi) through central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The race attracts teams 
	    from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools.
       <em><b>Trev</b></em>(two-seater renewable energy vehicle) was designed by the staff and students at the University of South Australia. 
	   <em><b>Trev</b></em> was first displayed at the 2005 World Solar Challenge as the concept of a low-mass, efficient commuter car. 
	   With 3 wheels and a mass of about 300 kg, the prototype car had maximum speed of 120 km/h and acceleration of 0â€“100 km/h in about 10 seconds. 
	   The running cost of Trev is projected to be less than 1/10 of the running cost of a small petrol car.</p>
